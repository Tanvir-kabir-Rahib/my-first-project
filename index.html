				A<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque" target="_blank"> Mosque</a></strong> also call masjid, is a plece of worship for Muslims. Amy Act of worship that follows the Islamic rules of prayer can be said to create a mosque, whether or not it takes place in a special buildinng. Informal and open-air places of worship are called musalla, while mosques used for communal prayer on Friday are know as juma. Mosque buildings typically contain an ornamental niche (Mihrab) set into the wall that indicates the direction of Qiblah, ablution facilities and minarets from which calls to prayer are issued. The pulpit (Mimbar), from which the Friday (Jumu'ah) sermon(Khutba) is delivered, was in earlier times of characteristic of the the central city mosque, but has since become common in smaller mosques. Mosques typically have segregated spaces for men and women. This basic pattern of organization has assumed different forms depenting on the region, period and denomination.

							<strong>Masjid al-Haram</strong> (Arabic: اَلْمَسْجِدُ ٱلْحَرَامُ‎, romanized: al-Masjid al-Ḥarām, lit. 'The Sacred Mosque'),[5] also known as the Great Mosque of Mecca,[6] is a mosque that surrounds the Kaaba in Mecca, in the Makkah Province of Saudi Arabia. It is a site of pilgrimage in the Hajj, which every Muslim must do at least once in their lives if able, and is also the main phase for the ʿUmrah, the lesser pilgrimage that can be undertaken any time of the year. The rites of both pilgrimages include circumambulating the Kaaba within the mosque. The Great Mosque includes other important significant sites, including the Black Stone, the Zamzam Well, Maqam Ibrahim, and the hills of Safa and Marwa. As of August 2020, the Great Mosque is the largest mosque and the eighth largest building in the world. The Great Mosque has undergone major renovations and expansions through the years.[8] It has passed through the control of various caliphs, sultans and kings, and is now under the control of the King of Saudi Arabia who is titled the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.[9]

						<p>
							<strong>Al-Masjid an-Nabawi</strong> (Arabic: المسجد النبوي‎, lit. 'The Prophetic Mosque'), known in English as The Prophet's Mosque, and also known as Al Haram, Al Haram Al Madani and Al Haram Al Nabawi by locals, is a mosque built by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the city of Medina in the Al Madinah Province of Saudi Arabia. It was the second mosque built by Muhammad in Medina, after Masjid Quba'a, and is now one of the largest mosques in the world. It is the second holiest site in Islam, after the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca. The land of Al-Masjid an-Nabawi belonged to two young orphans, Sahl and Suhayl, and when they came to know that Muhammad wished to acquire their land for the purposes of erecting a mosque, they went to Muhammad and offered the land to him as a gift; Muhammad insisted on paying a price for the land because they were orphaned children. The price agreed upon was paid by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, who thus became the endower or donor (Arabic: واقِف‎, romanized: waqif) of Al-Masjid an-Nabawi on behalf of, or in favor of, Muhammad.[4] al-Ansari also accommodated Muhammad upon his arrival at Madinah in 622

							<strong>Al-Aqsa Mosque</strong> (Arabic: ٱلْمَسْجِد ٱلْأَقْصَىٰ‎, romanized: al-Masjid al-ʾAqṣā, (About this soundlisten), "the Farthest Mosque"), located in the Old City of Jerusalem, is the third holiest site in Islam. The mosque was built on top of the Temple Mount, known as the Al Aqsa Compound or Haram esh-Sharif in Islam, several decades after Muhammad's death. Modern Muslims believe that Muhammad was transported from the Great Mosque of Mecca to this location during the Night Journey. Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad led prayers towards this site until the 16th or 17th month after his migration from Mecca to Medina, when Allah directed him to instead turn towards the Kaaba in Mecca. The covered mosque building was originally a small prayer house erected by Umar, the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, after the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the early 7th century. It was rebuilt and expanded by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik and finished by his son al-Walid in 705. The mosque was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 746 and rebuilt by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur in 754. It was rebuilt again in 780. Another earthquake destroyed most of al-Aqsa in 1033, but two years later the Fatimid caliph Ali az-Zahir built another mosque whose outline is preserved in the current structure. The mosaics on the arch at the qibla end of the nave also go back to his time.

							<strong>The Umayyad Mosque</strong> (Arabic: الْجَامِع الْأُمَوِي‎, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-ʾUmawī), also known as the Great Mosque of Damascus (Arabic: جَامِع بَنِي أُمَيَّة الْكَبِير‎, romanized: Jāmiʻ Banī Umayyah al-Kabīr), located in the old city of Damascus, is one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world. The mosque is also important in Islam because of its historical and eschatological reports and events associated with the mosque. The mosque is the fourth holiest site of Islam. After the Muslim conquest of Damascus in 634, the mosque was built on the site of a Christian basilica dedicated to John the Baptist, honored as a prophet by both Christians and Muslims. A legend dating to the sixth century holds that the building contains the head of John the Baptist. Two shrines commemorating Husayn ibn Ali (Arabic: مقام الحسين‎), whose martyrdom is frequently compared to that of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ, exist within the building premises. The mosque is also believed by Muslims to be the place where Jesus will return before End of Days. The mausoleum containing the tomb of Saladin stands in a small garden adjoining the north wall of the mosque.

							<strong>The Quba Mosque</strong> (Arabic: مَسْجِد قُبَاء‎, romanized: Masjid Qubāʾ) is a mosque located on the outskirts of Medina, Saudi Arabia. Initially, the mosque was built 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) off Medina in the village of Quba, before Medina expanded to include this village. Depending on whether the Mosque of the Companions in the Eritrean city of Massawa is older or not, it may be the first mosque in the world that dates to the lifetime of Muhammad in the 7th century CE. According to records, its first stones were positioned by Muhammad as soon as he arrived on his emigration from the city of Mecca to Medina, and the mosque was completed by his companions. Muhammad spent 14 days in this mosque praying qaṣr (Arabic: قَـصْـر‎, a short prayer) while waiting for Ali to arrive in Medina, after the latter stayed behind in Mecca to safeguard Muhammad’s life and safe escape by sleeping in Muhammad’s bed in his place, an event referred to in the Quran, sura al Baqara verse 207.[6] Also going along with traditional saying, this mosque is said to be where the first Friday prayer was held, led by Muhammad.(PBUH)
